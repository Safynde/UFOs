# UFOs
# Overview of the project 
       The UFO project provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. The requirements are date, city, state, country, and shape. The request displays a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The code shown in the table is JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap modified the website’s visuals. This code's primary goal is to create a webpage allowing viewers to easily navigate data related to UFO sightings. This information is filtered by entering commands into the designated areas. 
       
 # Results 
      Someone might use the new webpage through the search criteria process. One enters the information in the filter table on the left to look for a UFO sighting. First, enter the date information, next, enter the city, the state, the country, and the shape.

One of the drawbacks is that the user must know the shape entering the wrong shape will not provide any result. The other drawback is that the user needs to know the exact date of what he is looking for.
